# VF Takahashi Javascript
A simple Takahashi slide implementation in web browser.
Note: VF originally stands for variable fonts, but I found out that they're useless for now.

# Download
Just clone the repository or download root zip archive.
If you are skeptic, there're 3 files mandatory: vftakahashi.js, vftakahashi.css, and example.html.

# Edit Slides
1. Rename the example.html and edit its html title.
2. Edit/Add slide tags in html body.
3. Children tags of slide are w0, w1, w2, and w3; each of them are larger than the later.
4. w0 is hightlighted, so it should be your slide keyword.
5. Add a note tag if you see fit; note tag can contain any html code.

# Using Slides
## Keyboard Usage
Left/Right arrow key to change slide.
Up arrow display note if any. Down arrow will hide it.
## Mouse Usage
Click at bottom(about 1/5) to see note. Click anywhere to hide it.
Click left or rigth(about 1/3) to change slide.

# Theme Customization
Just edit the vftakahashi.css to your liking :)
